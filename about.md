Hello! I'm Matt Hall, a freshman Computer Science and Engineering major at The Ohio State University. Through my projects I'm working to develop skills and understanding in the fields that shape our future.

I've interned at the [Air Force Research Lab](https://www.wpafb.af.mil/AFRL/) researching fuel-cooled avionics systems and developed software to validate thermal controls models. My team designed and built both the [Beacon 3D Printer](https://github.com/halltech/beacon) and an [Industrial Large-Format 3D Printer](https://github.com/halltech/beacon/blob/master/Research.md). I'm currently working with the Ohio State University [EcoCAR](https://ecocar.osu.edu) team on Connected and Autonomated Vehicle technologies.
