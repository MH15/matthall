As you sit down to read this, a few thoughts might go through your head. Fleeting twitches of absolute shock, of disillusion. Myriad judgements that *anyone* in their right mind could thank that madman for anything he's done in light of the hate and injury he spreads on the daily. But I'll take an optimist's view on 45's [folly](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-defends-throwing-paper-towels-hurricane-survivors-puerto-rico-n808861), [hate](https://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/), and [national embarassments](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/angela-merkel-donald-trump-photo-viral-g7-shinzo-abe-a8392186.html) over the duration of this administration (so far) and propose a best-case scenario that definitely, aboslutely, certaintly will not come into fruition. We'll begin with [voting](#voting), work through [race](#race) and [hate](#hate), and probably touch on [money](#money) and [trade](#trade).

<a name="voting"></a>There's a metric called VAP (Voting Age Population)[^1] that shames American political advocates on the daily- hinting that the "normal American" either doesn't think their vote matters or can't be bothered to cast it. Our VAP (55.7% in 2016) pales in comparison to the other countries of OCED[^2].  This sucks. We suck. But thanks to Trump and his failures, we *might* be about to do a whole lot better. First, take a look at this figure comparing voter turnout among OCED countries:

<iframe src="http://www.pewresearch.org/chart/voter-turnout-around-the-world/iframe/" id="pew269509" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0"></iframe> <script type='text/javascript'id='pew-iframe'>(function(){function async_load(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='http://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/plugins/pew-scripts/js/iframeResizer.min.js';s.onload=s.onreadystatechange=function(){var rs=this.readyState;try{iFrameResize([],'iframe#pew269509')}catch(e){}};var embedder=document.getElementById('pew-iframe');embedder.parentNode.insertBefore(s,embedder)}if(window.attachEvent)window.attachEvent('onload',async_load);else window.addEventListener('load',async_load,false)})();</script>	

This plot yields a few key points of knowledge on the situation as a whole:

- Note the gap between **% of registered voters** and **% of voting age population**. Unlike most countries on the the graph, when we register people to vote, they vote. This may be due to the [automatic](https://www.ivotecef.org/avr_fact_sheet) or [universal](https://www.fairvote.org/universal_voter_registration) voter registration systems present in countries including Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, and Iraq, however it's still cause for celebration. When American voters register to vote they *actually vote*.
- Not that many Americans [register to vote](https://vote.gov). A possible solution is to implement a [universal](https://www.fairvote.org/universal_voter_registration) voter registration model already present in eight states and the District of Columbia, with many more states [actively](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/history-avr-implementation-dates) implementing such a system.
- Universal voter registration might not be enough to spark voter enthusiasm and would likely just shift our  **% of registered voters** ** left to meet the **% of voting age population** as more registered voters stay home.

An easier (albeit darker) method of increasing voter turnout is to merely wait for a calamity. This "anti-incumbency vote" surfaces when sufficient political and culture shock occurs and a blame game of sorts begins.
